This repository for my phthon home work, to see in the future how much I've improved.
I'm improving my code skills these days and whatching Udemy videos also taking Java bootcamp to become an SDET soon.

I try to create basic calculator program with Pyhton script.

This is a basic calculator program. In this calculator, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can be done with only two variables. I wanted some help from ChatGPT to make the code look better on the console. Sliding text looks really cool, I hope you like it :)
